# Principles of ESL

These are the core principles upon which ESL development is based, in no
particular order.

## "Black box"/"gray box" AI

## 2D/3D/abstract environments

## Perceptually limited "body syntonic" inputs and outputs (no "cheating")

## Generalization/transfer from simple environments to more complex ones

## Hand-designed models improved by reinforcement learning/genetic programming

## "Perfect is the enemy of [interesting/emergent/unexpected]."

## "Headway, not headlines."
